## Step 4: Take the top lace and make a small loop by folding it back on itself.

## Step 5: Pinch the base of the loop between your thumb and first finger of one hand, making sure it stays open.

## Step 6: With the other hand, make a similar loop with the other lace.

## Step 7: Take the second loop and lay it over the first loop, so that they cross in the middle and form an "X" shape again.

## Step 8: Take the second loop and tuck it behind the first loop, so that the second loop is now underneath the first loop.

## Step 9: With one hand, hold onto the loops where they cross in the middle. With the other hand, take the ends of both laces and pull them tight, making sure the loops stay in place.

###### To tighten the knot further, pull on the loops.
